# Honoka Nishimura – Developer Portfolio

This is my personal developer portfolio built with **Remix**, showcasing selected frontend and full-stack development projects.

The site highlights my experience in React, Laravel, and TypeScript through real-world inspired applications and design briefs.  
The layout and animation were built from scratch using modern tools to ensure a high level of interactivity and responsiveness.

## About

I’m a full-stack developer based in Japan with hands-on experience in **PHP (Laravel)**, **React**, and **TypeScript**.  
My recent focus has been on building interactive UIs and scalable backend systems using Remix, Next.js, and server-side rendering.  
Open to fully remote roles across U.S., European, or flexible time zones.
